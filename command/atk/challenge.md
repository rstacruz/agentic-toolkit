description: Challenge assumptions
---

Challenge the current plan's assumptions and adjust as needed.

1. Identify assumptions
   - Identify assumptions that have been used to address the current plan.
   - List them, and give a certainty rating to each (low, medium, high, absolutely certain).

2. Identify questions
   - Collect questions to research to find out more about each assumption.
   - Focus on questions that, when answered, will increase the certainty of each assumption.

3. Research 
   - Spawn a @general agent to answer these questions.
   - Spawn multiple agents as needed (max 5), parallelising multiple questions across each.

4. Evaluate
   - Evaluate the responses to see if this changes anything about the plan.
