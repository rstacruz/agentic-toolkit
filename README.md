# Agentic toolkit

Some indispensable prompts and tools I use with [Opencode](https://opencode.ai/).

## Installation

- Install Opencode
- Copy `agent/` files into `~/.config/opencode/agent/`
- Copy `command/` files into `~/.config/opencode/command/`

## Use cases

### plan-with-context

- Use this to plan your work instead of the `plan` mode.
- It will keep its plans in `CONTEXT.local.md`. This is a form of intentional compaction
