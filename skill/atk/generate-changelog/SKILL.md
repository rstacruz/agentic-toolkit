# Generate Changelog

Update or create `artefacts/changelog.md` to document the completed work.

## Structure

- **Background:** Context/problem statement
- **Scope:** Summary of work done
- **Automated verification:** Steps taken (brief list)
- **Manual verification:** Steps and outputs

## Guidelines

- Be concise, minimize tokens
- Make verification steps self-contained (include setup from clean clone)
- Aim for another engineer to understand work was done sufficiently

## When to Use
- After implementation, verification, and review are successful
