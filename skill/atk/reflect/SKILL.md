# Reflection guidelines

Examine the session so far, the skills used, and the project guidelines.

1. Give suggestions to revise the skills prompts to be more fitting to the user's needs. Give suggested additions in `markdown` code fences, and suggested deletions/changes in `diff` code fences.

2. Give suggestions to the project guidelines (AGENTS.md, AGENTS.local.md) for future agents to prevent straying down unproductive paths. Make edits to AGENTS.md.
